In this repo you will find a json file updated from time-to-time if the list of AWS Services.

`aws_services.json`

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groorj/aws-services-list/main/aws_services.json`

## This project uses

This project uses Python to scrape the AWS services page and generate a json file with the service name, the service category and a description.

You can find the AWS services page here: https://aws.amazon.com/products/

## Notes

- This repo does not contain the Python script that generates the json file.
- I will do my best to keep the json file updated.
- Use this code at your own risk. I am NOT responsable for it's usage and I CANNOT guarantee it will be updated or working as expected.
- You can list AWS services using the API or the CLI but it is not guaranteed that all services will be listed.
